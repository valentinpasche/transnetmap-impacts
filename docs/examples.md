# Examples

> **TBD** â€” The examples will include:
>
> - A **full workflow (PostGIS)** example: real schema, configuration (`ParamConfig`), and exported choropleth maps
> - Links to pre-executed notebooks via **nbviewer**
>
> For now, the repository may include exported **HTML maps** and **screenshots** in `docs/examples/` for quick preview.  
> All data for [Get Started](./get_started.md) is also in `tests/get_started/`
