# Examples

> **TBD** â€” The examples will include:
>
> - A **toy quick tour** (no DB), demonstrating the 6-step pipeline on small in-memory data
> - A **full workflow (PostGIS)** example: real schema, configuration (`ParamConfig`), and exported choropleth maps
> - Links to pre-executed notebooks via **nbviewer**
>
> For now, the repository may include exported **HTML maps** and **screenshots** in `examples/output/` for quick preview.
